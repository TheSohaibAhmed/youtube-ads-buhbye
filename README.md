## About The Project

Youtube ad. block or others don't seem to be working. Here's a work around: This tiny extension works only on Youtube (it could on other websites for sure, but I didn't code that in), and speeds up any video that's under 20 seconds by 16x. And boom: buhbye adverts.

I'm sure it has some bugs, but not bad because it took only 30 mins (and happens to be the first extension I've written).

## Downside

You'll have to switch the icon to off, if you want to watch videos that are 20 seconds or shorter (aka shorts).

## Further thoughts

I think having a keyboard shortcut should make the whole experience even better
